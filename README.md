# Dead Reckoning Budget Simulation

This repo contains iterative budget work for the
Dead Reckoning budget. 

## Current Budget 

**WHAT THIS IS:**
  - Dead Reckoning budget proposal that smooths sample rates over time and allows us to weight some defenses heavier
    than others
    
**WHAT THIS IS NOT:**
  - A budgeting system that understands the deprecation of outstanding liability over time. (With this budget we
    consider a released block a 100% liability for the full 30 days)
